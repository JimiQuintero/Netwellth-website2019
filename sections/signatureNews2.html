        If you're fortunate enough to have access to a 401(k) through your employer, take full advantage of it. Only
        around 53% of workers over the
        age of 22 have access to a defined contribution plan, such as a 401(k), according to a Pew survey. Of those who
        have access to this type of
        plan, however, only 38% actually participate.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're able to contribute up to $19,000 per year to your 401(k), according to the IRS's 2019 contribution limit
        guidelines, making it one of
        the most powerful tools in your retirement planning toolbox. In addition, if your employer offers any type of
        matching contributions, you
        could be receiving what's essentially free money simply by stashing cash in your retirement account.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, not all 401(k)s are created equal, and some offer better perks than others. While you may not have
        the ability to switch to a new
        401(k) -- at least without changing jobs -- it's sometimes helpful to see how your plan stacks up. If you're
        lucky enough to have access to a
        401(k) that's better than average in several categories, make the most of it by saving as much as you can.
      </p>

      <h6 class="bold">Contribution rates</h6>
      <p>
        Your 401(k) contribution rate is the percentage of your salary that you're stashing away -- which includes both
        your own contributions as
        well as any additional contributions from your employer.
      </p>
      <p>
        A full 95% of organizations offer some type of employer contribution -- such as matching contributions, profit
        sharing options, or an
        employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) -- according to a study from Vanguard. Also, of those employers that offer
        matching contributions,
        the average match is around 4.3% of the employee's wages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average employee participating in a 401(k) contributes just under 7% of their salary, according to Vanguard,
        and the average total
        contribution rate (including any employer contributions) is around 10.6%.
      </p>
      <h6 class="bold">Account balances</h6>
      <p>
        According to Vanguard, the average 401(k) account balance is $92,148. But that number is skewed by power savers
        who have hundreds of
        thousands of dollars stashed away, so a more accurate representation of how much workers have saved is the
        median amount -- which is
        just $22,217.
      </p>
      <p>
        These numbers account for workers across all ages, though, so the statistics alone don't paint the entire
        picture -- someone in their 20s
        with $90,000 saved is in far better shape than someone in their 60s with that amount in their retirement fund.
        Here's what the median
        401(k) balance looks like by age:

      <p>
        Keep in mind, too, that even if your 401(k) balance is in line with or even higher than the average, that
        doesn't necessarily mean you're on
        track to retire comfortably. You'll likely need hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings to last the rest of
        your life, so it's important to
        calculate your retirement number to personalize your retirement plan.
      </p>
      <h6 class="bold">Fees</h6>
      <p>
        Everyone pays fees when investing in a retirement account, but not everyone realizes how much they're paying (or
        that they're paying
        anything at all). Thirty-seven percent of Americans mistakenly believe they don't pay any 401(k) fees, a survey
        from TD Ameritrade found,
        and another 36% either don't know whether they're paying fees or aren't sure how to determine what they're
        paying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average 401(k) charges fees of around 1% of total assets under management, according to a study from the
        Center for American
        Progress. So if you have $100,000 in your 401(k), that means you'd be paying around $1,000 per year in fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different types of fees you may be paying, but the most important figure to look for is the expense
        ratio -- which is the
        percentage of your savings that goes toward the administrative and general management costs involved in running
        your account. To find
        your expense ratio, you can either check your account statements or talk to your plan administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you discover that you're paying more than average, you can ask your plan administrator if you can shift your
        investments to different
        funds with lower fees. That's not always a possibility, though, so in that case, you may choose to save enough
        in your 401(k) to earn any
        employer matching contributions, then put the rest of your cash in an IRA with lower fees.
      </p>
      <h6 class="bold">Availability of additional resources</h6>
      <p>
        Roughly 61% of companies offer one-on-one financial counseling for their employees, a survey from financial
        services organization Alight
        Solutions found, and 60% offer online tools and guidance to help workers make the most informed investing
        decisions.
      </p>
      <p>You may have access to these types of resources without even realizing it, so if you're unsure, ask your plan
        administrator or check out your
        plan's website to see what's available to you. Approximately 60% of Americans investing in 401(k)s and IRAs say
        they have little to no
        confidence in managing their own investments, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank found. So if you're
        struggling to make sense of your
        money and need help, it's worthwhile to see whether your 401(k) plan offers any financial advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your 401(k) is a powerful tool, but only if you make the most of it. Taking a proactive approach and learning as
        much as you can about your
        plan and how it compares to other retirement accounts can help you make more informed investing decisions, which
        will in turn help you
        save more for the future.
