  "401(k) and Self-Funded Healthcare OPTIMIZED for Cost and Service Efficiency" => "<p>The Net<b>Wellth</b><sup>SM</sup> consulting approach is most effective for employers with 100-250 employees, looking to drive down health insurance and retirement plan costs, increase participation, and elevate the employee experience/satisfaction.</p><p>Rather than earn commissions for product sales, Net<b>Wellth</b><sup>SM</sup> empowers clients by making their objectives, the measure of our compensation. Net<b>Wellth</b><sup>SM</sup> grows only when our clients do; both parties profit as our clients achieve cost savings, employee satisfaction, and increased participation.</p><p>Being a client means the cost and service inefficiencies in your current 401(k) and Health Insurance are large enough and statistically recoverable enough, to take action.

Each of the Series is a progressive step in managing the controllables of the healthcare supply chain. Since our compensation is a function of Cost Savings, Participation, and Employee Satisfaction; we operate with the aligned objectives of  enhancing the employee engagement, with healthcare, and maximizing cost savings. </p><p>Employees are empowered with complete transparency in cost vs. quality of care, and benefit from a partial refund of the unused premiums collected, at the completion of each fiscal year. Quarterly On-Site Wellth<b>Training</b><sup>SM</sup> and the Wellth<b>Board</b><sup>SM</sup> gives participants the guidance and automated solutions to track and improve their personal wealth and lifestyle wellness.</p>",
  "Cost and Service Inefficiencies of a 401(k)" => "<p>401(k) is proven to be the most highly-effective, tax-qualified, long-term savings tool in America.</p><p>Yet, pre-packaged 401(k) plans tend to have layers of fees that are not easy to identify, or in some cases, required to be disclosed as Standard Pricing. These fees are not one-time, rather recurring AND charged as a percentage of assets in the plan. Thats right, you pay more as your account grows. Over time, these fees add up to exorbitant amounts, eroding your account accumulation, year after year. Such fees take the form of back-end revenue sharing and/or embedded overrides, both causing recurring charges that stack against your investment returns and add ongoing resistance to your accounts growth. Could you have done better in a low cost index fund? In many cases, yes.</p><p>How about the service? 401(k) plans are typically serviced by commissioned-based financial advisors. Most of these advisors make a living selling expensive financial products to people who have the money, to buy them; typically a small percentage of most employer groups. This is the root of declining service value for employees.</p>",
