        Here’s a strange paradox: Health-care costs have increased by an unsustainable rate of about 8.5% each year over
        the past decade, according to
        PwC’s Health Research Institute. Already, the average employer-based family health insurance plans costs more
        than $18,000 annually .
      </p>
      <p>
        But Medicare spending has been relatively stable. Over the past three years, the program’s payouts to hospitals
        have increased by only 1% to 3% a
        year, roughly even with inflation. The prices paid for some core services, such as ambulance transportation,
        have actually gone down.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see what’s happening, we can start by pulling back the curtain on how preferred provider organizations do
        business. A PPO is a network of
        preferred health-care providers such as doctors and hospitals, typically assembled by an insurance carrier. In
        theory, the insurer can save money
        for its customers by persuading providers in the network to discount their services in exchange for driving
        volume to their facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus, for instance, boasts that its PPO—a network of more than 780,000
        professionals—cuts the cost of typical doctor
        visits by 52%, while saving 69% on MRIs. Pull back the curtain, and you’ll see these discounts are an accounting
        trick. To allow PPOs to advertise big
        discounts, providers simply inflate their billed charges on a whole range of services and treatments.
      </p>
      <p>Don’t insurers have a natural incentive to keep provider prices down, even if they don’t end up paying the list
        price?</p>
      <p>
        In fact, no—at least not since the Affordable Care Act took effect. That law established a “medical loss ratio,”
        which requires insurers covering
        individuals and small businesses to spend at least 80 cents of every premium dollar on medical expenses. Only 20
        cents can go toward
        administrative costs and profit. (For insurers offering large group plans, the MLR rises to 85%.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If a provider raises the cost of a blood test or medical procedure, insurers can charge higher premiums, while
        also boosting the value of their 20%
        share. Insurers can make more money only if they lower their administrative expenses or charge higher premiums.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, the MLR rule encourages insurers to ignore providers’ artificial price hikes. Insurers can continue
        to attract customers with the promise
        of steep discounts through their PPO plans—and providers can continue to ratchet up their prices. By hoodwinking
        their customers, both insurers
        and providers make more money. Since insurance costs are merely a derivative of health-care costs, the result
        has been a steady rise in insurance
        costs for millions of working families.
      </p>
      <p>
        For employers caught in this price spiral, there is a way out: partial or full self- insurance. When businesses
        self-insure, they pay employee health
        claims directly. That creates an incentive for businesses to question—and push back on—providers’ price
        increases. Self-insuring businesses can
        strengthen their leverage by using “reference- based pricing,” which caps payments for
        “shoppable”—nonemergency—services at the average
        price in a local market. Members who use providers with prices below the limit receive full coverage. If they
        use a provider that charges more than
        the limit, they pay the difference out-of-pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        This setup creates a strong incentive to control costs: Patients have a reason to shop around for the best
        value, while providers are pressured to
        keep their prices below the cap. The most expensive doctor is not always the doctor with the best outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s what happened when the California Public Employees’ Retirement System adopted a reference-pricing
        approach a few years ago. The
        agency had noticed that provider charges for hip and knee replacements varied from $15,000 to $110,000. In 2010,
        Calpers established a reference
        price of $30,000 for the procedures. Predictably, patients flocked to providers charging that price or less and
        shunned higher-cost facilities. Over
        the next couple of years, the number of California hospitals charging below $30,000 for a hip replacement jumped
        by more than 50%. In the first
        year Calpers saved an estimated $2.8 million on joint replacements.
      </p>
      <p>
        What worked for Calpers can work just as effectively for small and midsize businesses. Today’s medical inflation
        is exactly what one would expect
        from health policies that reward insurers and providers for raising prices. Employers shouldn’t accept this
        status quo. By self-insuring and setting
        their own reference-based reimbursement, businesses can sidestep the traditional insurance model that continues
        to bleed them dry.
